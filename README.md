Overview of the Project

Research Topic:  AI in Education: Investigate the impact of Generative AI in Education

Project Description

Research Question: To what extent would generative AI impact student engagement and motivation in customized learning environments?


Hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: Generative AI tools facilitate students' learning by allowing immediate, differentiated feedback that students need to grasp complex concepts and supporting self-directed learning
Hypothesis 2: Using generative AI as an additional learning aid increases student engagement by promoting learning through more interactive, adaptive, and accessible means.  
Hypothesis 3: Teachers view generative AI as an excellent way to enhance educational support, but they express concern about potentially becoming over-dependent on it, changes in trends of critical thinking skills, and issues of academic honesty.
